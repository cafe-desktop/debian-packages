Description: icon theme caching utility
 ctk-update-icon-cache creates mmap()able cache files for icon themes.
 .
 CTK can use the cache files created by ctk-update-icon-cache to avoid a lot
 of system call and disk seek overhead when the application starts. Since the
 format of the cache files allows them to be mmap()ed shared between multiple
 applications, the overall memory consumption is reduced as well.
