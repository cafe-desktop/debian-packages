Description: C# like language for the GObject system
 Bala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming
 language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional
 runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to
 applications and libraries written in C.

 balac, the Bala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates
 Bala source code into C source and header files.  It uses the GObject
 type system to create classes and interfaces declared in the Bala
 source code. This package also contains the bala-gen-introspect and
 bapigen binaries that will automatically generate Bala bindings.
